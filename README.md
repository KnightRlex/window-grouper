# window-grouper
A productivity tool for Windows that groups multiple application windows into a single tabbed or grid interface. Built with Python and PyQt5 to maximize space on small screens and streamline complex workflows.

WindowGrouper: Professional Window Management for Power Users 
Overview 

In today's multi-tasking digital environment, juggling numerous application windows on a single monitor can be a significant productivity bottleneck. WindowGrouper is a sophisticated utility engineered to solve this problem. It is designed for professionals, developers, and anyone with limited screen real estate or a workflow that demands constant interaction with multiple programs. By grouping external application windows into a single, manageable interface, WindowGrouper helps you reclaim your desktop and focus on what matters most. 
Core Functionality: Tab and Grid Layouts 

WindowGrouper offers two primary modes for organizing your workspace: 

     Tab Mode: This mode functions like a modern web browser, allowing you to consolidate different applications into a series of tabs. Switching between a report in Microsoft Word, a spreadsheet in Excel, and a reference web page becomes as simple as clicking a tab.
     Grid Mode: For tasks requiring simultaneous viewing, Grid Mode splits the main window into resizable panes. This is ideal for side-by-side code comparison, monitoring multiple log files, or keeping an eye on a communication application while working.
     

Technical Architecture 

Built on a robust foundation of Python and the PyQt5 framework, WindowGrouper leverages low-level Windows API calls to seamlessly manipulate and embed external application windows. This direct interaction with the operating system allows it to "re-parent" windows, effectively making them children of the WindowGrouper interface while retaining their core functionality. 
Key Features and Menu Navigation 

The application's power is accessible through an intuitive menu system. 

     View Menu: This menu controls the display and behavior of the main window.
         Always on Top: Keeps the WindowGrouper interface visible above all other applications, ensuring constant access to navigation controls.
         Tab Mode / Grid Mode: Instantly switch between the two primary layout views to suit your current task.
         
     Window Menu: This menu is essential for advanced workflow management.
         New Group Window: Launches a completely independent instance of WindowGrouper. This powerful feature allows you to create multiple, isolated workspaces for different projects, preventing clutter and improving organization.
         
     

Workflow and Keyboard Shortcuts 

Efficiency is at the heart of WindowGrouper, which is why it includes several keyboard shortcuts to streamline navigation. 
Shortcut
 	
Action
 
 Ctrl + N	Open a new, independent WindowGrouper window. 
Ctrl + 1	Switch to Tab Mode. 
Ctrl + 2	Switch to Grid Mode. 
Ctrl + T	Toggle "Always on Top" on/off. 
Ctrl + Space	Switch to the next tab. 
Ctrl + Shift + Space	Switch to the previous tab. 
 
  

Important Note on Shortcut Behavior: The primary navigation shortcut, Ctrl+Space, is context-aware. It functions reliably when the main WindowGrouper window itself is active. When you click into an embedded application (e.g., to type in Microsoft Word), the shortcut will cease to function until you click back on the WindowGrouper's title bar or frame to return focus to the main application. 
Compatibility and Known Limitations 

WindowGrouper is compatible with a wide range of standard Windows applications. However, due to the complex nature of window manipulation, certain applications exhibit known limitations: 

     Microsoft Excel: While the main Excel window can be grouped, resizing may not correctly scale the inner worksheet grid, and cell interaction often becomes unresponsive.
     Microsoft Paint: Grouping Paint may cause background transparency issues within the canvas area.
     Heavyweight Applications (e.g., AutoCAD, Video Editors, Games): These applications can typically be added and resized within the WindowGrouper interface. However, direct interaction with their UI elements (toolbars, canvases, viewports) is often blocked. The application is rendered but not fully controllable.
     

Future development and proposed improvements for experienced Python developers to implement (I'm a novice) 

The development roadmap is focused on enhancing compatibility and user experience. Key areas for improvement include: 

     Enhanced Application Compatibility: A primary goal is to resolve the specific issues with Microsoft Excel and other applications that do not resize or interact correctly. This involves deeper investigation into how these applications handle their rendering and input loops.
     Global Shortcut Integration: We aim to implement a global keyboard hook to allow the Ctrl+Space shortcut to work regardless of which window currently has focus. This would provide a seamless and uninterrupted workflow. The implementation of this feature is currently blocked by a system dependency issue (pywin32 Error 126: The specified module could not be found), which indicates missing or inaccessible system libraries on the Windows environment. This is a known issue that we are actively investigating to find a robust solution for all users.

     
     
     Comparing WindowGrouper against the established and excellent FancyZones and Workspaces features from Microsoft PowerToys is a great way to understand its unique value proposition. 

While PowerToys sets a high bar for system-wide utilities, WindowGrouper carves out a unique and powerful niche by focusing on a different philosophy of window management. They are not direct competitors but rather tools designed for different tasks. 

Here is a detailed comparison highlighting the advantages of WindowGrouper. 
Core Philosophical Difference 

     FancyZones & Workspaces (PowerToys): These are system-level layout managers. They treat your entire desktop as their canvas. FancyZones helps you snap windows into predefined zones on your screen, but the windows remain independent, top-level entities managed by the OS.
     WindowGrouper: This is an application container. It acts as a host that "adopts" external application windows, making them children of its own interface. It fundamentally changes the parent-child relationship of the windows it manages.
     

This core difference leads to several distinct advantages. 
Feature-by-Feature Comparison 
Feature
 	
FancyZones (PowerToys)
 	
Workspaces (PowerToys)
 	
WindowGrouper (Project)
 
 Primary Function	Arranges windows in non-overlapping grid layouts on your screen.	Saves and restores entire desktop configurations across multiple monitors.	Embeds multiple applications into a single, tabbed or grid-based container window. 
Window Interaction	Full Control. You interact with each window normally, as if it were on the desktop.	Full Control. Workspaces only launches and positions windows; you interact with them normally.	Contained Control. You interact with windows inside the container. This can sometimes limit interaction with complex apps. 
Multi-Tasking Model	Side-by-Side Viewing. Excellent for comparing two or more windows simultaneously.	Session-Based. Excellent for switching between entire project setups (e.g., "Work" vs. "Gaming").	Tabbed Workflow. Excellent for rapidly switching between tasks within a single project, like a browser. 
Multi-Instance Workflow	Not Applicable. You have one desktop. You can create different zone layouts, but they apply globally.	Global Switching. You switch the entire desktop's state from one setup to another.	True Isolation. You can run multiple, completely separate WindowGrouper instances, each with its own set of apps. 
Persistence	Remembers your zone layouts.	Remembers which apps were open and on which monitor.	Saves the specific applications embedded within a single WindowGrouper instance. 
 
  
The Key Advantages of WindowGrouper 

Based on this comparison, the advantages of WindowGrouper become clear for specific use cases. 
1. The "Browser" Paradigm for Desktop Apps 

This is the most significant advantage. Just as a web browser consolidates multiple websites into tabs, WindowGrouper consolidates multiple applications into tabs. This creates a clean, unified workspace for a single project, reducing cognitive load and desktop clutter dramatically. For a researcher with a Word document, several PDFs, and a web browser, WindowGrouper provides a level of task consolidation that FancyZones cannot. 
2. True Project Isolation 

The ability to launch multiple, independent WindowGrouper instances is a killer feature for professionals managing multiple clients or projects. You can have one window for "Project Alpha" (with its specific Word docs and Excel sheets) and another for "Project Beta." These workspaces are truly isolated from one another, preventing the mix-up of files and applicationsâ€”a level of separation that PowerToys' global Workspaces doesn't offer in the same contained way. 
3. Fluid and Dynamic Workflow 

Switching between tasks with Ctrl+Space is instantaneous and keeps you within the context of the application. While FancyZones requires you to move your mouse and click between different windows, WindowGrouper lets you keep your hands on the keyboard, leading to a faster, more fluid workflow for tasks that require frequent context switching. 
4. A Niche, Custom-Built Tool 

Because it's a custom Python script, WindowGrouper is highly specialized and can be tailored to unique needs. While PowerToys aims for broad compatibility, WindowGrouper` was built specifically to solve the "too many windows for one screen" problem in the most direct way possible: by putting them all inside one another. 
Conclusion: When to Use Which Tool 

     

    Choose PowerToys (FancyZones/Workspaces) for: 
         General-purpose window management.
         Users who need to interact with the full, unmodified UI of all their applications (especially critical for Excel, AutoCAD, etc.).
         Managing complex multi-monitor setups.
         Stability and official support are top priorities.
         
     

    Choose WindowGrouper for: 
         Deep Work: When you need to focus on a single project with many associated applications.
         The "Browser" Workflow: If you think of your work in terms of "tabs" rather than "windows."
         Project Isolation: If you work on multiple distinct projects and need to keep their applications completely separate.
         Users who prioritize task consolidation and keyboard-driven workflow over absolute compatibility with every single application.
         
     

They are not competitors but complementary tools. PowerToys is the excellent utility for managing your entire desktop, while WindowGrouper is the specialist's tool for mastering the chaos within a single, complex project.
